        Sometimes you may want to keep track of, record, and be reminded of
        events that take place or should take place within a particular
        <i>timeframe</i> (i.e. every hour, day, week, month or even every year);
        however, all you care about is <i>whether or not the event actually took
        place within their expected timeframe</i>.
      </p>
      <!-- ul>
        <li>
          Exactly <i>when within the hour</i> an hourly event needs to take place.
        </li>
        <li>
          Exactly <i>when within the day</i> a daily event needs to take place.
        </li>
        <li>
        </li>
      </ul -->

      <p>For example:</p>

      <p>
        Let's say you want to make sure you...
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Drink two-8 oz. glasses of water every hour of every day.
        </li>
        <li>
          Work out at least three times a week.
        </li>
        <li>
          Take at least one 5-minute break every hour during the course of
          a work day.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        It doesn't necessarily matter to exactly <i>when</i>
        you drink those two-8 oz. glasses of water within the hour, or on <i>what
        days</i> you work out during the week, or even <i>what time</i> you
        take your 5-minute work break every hour.

        <i>What really matters is that you do</i>.

            People are busy. Accumoo sets you up for success, not failure. Calendar
            events and schedules
            rarely happen as planned. When personal calendar events, for example,
            fail to take place, they are rarely reschduled. This is due, in part,
            to the conventional calendar event which is rigidly bound to a
            specific date and time. This system sets people up for failure.
            Accumoo events, on the other hand, are date and time agnostic.
            Accumoo events can take place <i>anywhere</i> within the timeframe
            chosen by the user. This system provides more flexibility and sets
            you up for success.
          </li>
          <li>
            Accumoo's events are date and time agnostic, allowing the user
            to engage an event at their leisure, when it's convenient for <i>them</i>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Calendar events are merely a rigid placeholder for a scheduled event.
            There is no metadata
            associated with a calendar event. For example, an event in a calendar
            cannot indicate whether or not the event actually took place. An Accumoo event,
            on the other hand, is a <i>flexible</i> placeholder that records whether
            or not the event actually took place, as well as the date and time
            the event took place. In addition to this, Accumoo event metadata
            records whether or not a series of related events has taken place
            in part or <i>in toto</i>. This affords Accumoo the ability to
            provide statistical data for each event (pro version).
